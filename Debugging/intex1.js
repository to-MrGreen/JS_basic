//---Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable----
/*
Both Chrome and Firefox have excellent JavaScript consoles, also known as DevTools, for debugging your JavaScript.

You can find Developer tools in your Chrome's menu or Web Console in Firefox's menu. If you're using a different browser, or a mobile phone, we strongly recommend switching to desktop Firefox or Chrome.

The console.log() method, which "prints" the output of what's within its parentheses to the console, will likely be the most helpful debugging tool. Placing it at strategic points in your code can show you the intermediate values of variables. It's good practice to have an idea of what the output should be before looking at what it is. Having check points to see the status of your calculations throughout your code will help narrow down where the problem is.

Here's an example to print the string Hello world! to the console:

console.log('Hello world!');
*/
let a = 5;
console.log(a)
let b = 1;
a++;
// Only change code below this line


let sumAB = a + b;
console.log(sumAB);

//-------Understanding the Differences between the freeCodeCamp and Browser Console---------
/*
You may have noticed that some freeCodeCamp challenges include their own console. This console behaves a little differently than the browser console.

There are many methods to use with console to output messages. log, warn, and clear to name a few. The freeCodeCamp console will only output log messages, while the browser console will output all messages. When you make changes to your code, it will automatically run and show the logs. The freeCodeCamp console is then cleared each time your code runs.
*/
let output = "Get this to show once in the freeCodeCamp console and not at all in the browser console";
console.log(output);
console.clear();

//----Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable------
/*
You can use typeof to check the data structure, or type, of a variable. This is useful in debugging when working with multiple data types. If you think you're adding two numbers, but one is actually a string, the results can be unexpected. Type errors can lurk in calculations or function calls. Be careful especially when you're accessing and working with external data in the form of a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object.

Here are some examples using typeof:

console.log(typeof "");
console.log(typeof 0);
console.log(typeof []);
console.log(typeof {});
In order, the console will display the strings string, number, object, and object.

JavaScript recognizes six primitive (immutable) data types: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, and Symbol (new with ES6) and one type for mutable items: Object. Note that in JavaScript, arrays are technically a type of object
*/

let seven = 7;
let three = "3";
console.log(seven + three);
// Only change code below this line
console.log(typeof seven);
console.log(typeof three);

//-----Catch Misspelled Variable and Function Names---------

let receivables = 10;
let payables = 8;
let netWorkingCapital = receivables - payables;
console.log(`Net working capital is: ${netWorkingCapital}`);

//-------Catch Unclosed Parentheses, Brackets, Braces and Quotes--------

let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
let arraySum = myArray.reduce((previous, current) =>  (previous + current));
console.log(`Sum of array values is: ${arraySum}`);

//------Catch Mixed Usage of Single and Double Quotes---------
/*
JavaScript allows the use of both single (') and double (") quotes to declare a string. Deciding which one to use generally comes down to personal preference, with some exceptions.

Having two choices is great when a string has contractions or another piece of text that's in quotes. Just be careful that you don't close the string too early, which causes a syntax error.

Here are some examples of mixing quotes:

const grouchoContraction = "I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.";
const quoteInString = "Groucho Marx once said 'Quote me as saying I was mis-quoted.'";
const uhOhGroucho = 'I've had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn't it.';
The first two are correct, but the third is incorrect.

Of course, it is okay to use only one style of quotes. You can escape the quotes inside the string by using the backslash (\) escape character:

const allSameQuotes = 'I\'ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn\'t it.';
*/

let innerHtml = "<p>Click here to <a href=\"#Home\">return home</a></p>";
console.log(innerHtml);

//----Catch Use of Assignment Operator Instead of Equality Operator-------
/*
Branching programs, i.e. ones that do different things if certain conditions are met, rely on if, else if, and else statements in JavaScript. The condition sometimes takes the form of testing whether a result is equal to a value.

This logic is spoken (in English, at least) as "if x equals y, then ..." which can literally translate into code using the =, or assignment operator. This leads to unexpected control flow in your program.

As covered in previous challenges, the assignment operator (=) in JavaScript assigns a value to a variable name. And the == and === operators check for equality (the triple === tests for strict equality, meaning both value and type are the same).

The code below assigns x to be 2, which evaluates as true. Almost every value on its own in JavaScript evaluates to true, except what are known as the "falsy" values: false, 0, "" (an empty string), NaN, undefined, and null.

let x = 1;
let y = 2;
if (x = y) {

} else {

}
In this example, the code block within the if statement will run for any value of y, unless y is falsy. The else block, which we expect to run here, will not actually run.
*/
let x = 7;
let y = 9;
let result = "to come";

if(x == y) {
  result = "Equal!";
} else {
  result = "Not equal!";
}

console.log(result);

//-----Catch Missing Open and Closing Parenthesis After a Function Call---------
/* 
When a function or method doesn't take any arguments, you may forget to include the (empty) opening and closing parentheses when calling it. Often times the result of a function call is saved in a variable for other use in your code. This error can be detected by logging variable values (or their types) to the console and seeing that one is set to a function reference, instead of the expected value the function returns.

The variables in the following example are different:

function myFunction() {
  return "You rock!";
}
let varOne = myFunction;
let varTwo = myFunction();
Here varOne is the function myFunction, and varTwo is the string You rock!.
*/
function getNine() {
  let x = 6;
  let y = 3;
  return x + y;
}

let result = getNine();
console.log(result);

//------Catch Arguments Passed in the Wrong Order When Calling a Function-------

function raiseToPower(b, e) {
  return Math.pow(b,e);
}

let base = 2;
let exp = 3;
let power = raiseToPower(base, exp);
console.log(power);

//-----Catch Off By One Errors When Using Indexing-------

function zeroArray(m, n) {
  // Creates a 2-D array with m rows and n columns of zeroes
  let newArray = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    // Adds the m-th row into newArray
  let row = [];
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      // Pushes n zeroes into the current row to create the columns
      row.push(0);
    }
    // Pushes the current row, which now has n zeroes in it, to the array
    newArray.push(row);
  }
  return newArray;
}

let matrix = zeroArray(3, 2);
console.log(matrix);
